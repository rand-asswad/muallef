# Temporal segmentation

## Introduction

Temporal segmentation is the task of finding time boundaries
of audio objects, in the case of music signals the audio
objects in question are the musical *notes*.

A musical note's **onset** is defined as the time it starts,
and its ending time is the **offset**.

The signal form varies according to instruments.
The onset profile in the image above corresponds to
an instrument producing sudden energy bursts such as
a pinched-chord instrument (piano, guitar, etc),
or a percussive instrument,
unlike bowed-chord instruments and wind instruments
that do no exhibit such energy bursts.
In both cases, the spectral flux, changes in energy,
and/or harmonic distribution are analysed in order
to estimate onset times.

The general onset estimation model is a three-step pipeline [@brossier]

1. Computing an **Onset Detection Function (ODF)** that
  characterizes change in energy and/or harmonic content
  in a music signal.
  The change is measured in the time domain, frequency domain,
  phase domain, or complex domain for analysing onsets
  of sounds of different natures.
2. Calculate a smooth **threshold function** as ODFs
  tend to be sensitive to the slightest changes, therefore
  providing a threshold for viable onset candidates.
3. **Peak-picking** local maxima of the ODF that are
  greater than the calculated threshold.

## Onset Detection Function (ODF)

We present a few functions that analyse different features
of a musical sound that correspond to subsets of musical sources.

### High Frequency Content (HFC)

The proposed function [@hfc] favours wide-band energy bursts
over changes in amplitude modulation, and accords a stronger weight
to high frequency spectral bins.

$$D_{\text{HFC}}[n] = \sum\limits_{k=1}^{N}
    k\cdot\norm{X[n,k]}^2$$

The function emphasises high frequency energy bursts,
which makes it more adapted to percussive onsets than
than bowed-strings or wind instruments. [@brossier]

### Phase Deviation

A different approach proposed by [@bello], where the function
evaluates phase difference that can help identify *tonal*
onsets as well as percussive onsets.

$$D_{\Phi}[n] = \sum\limits_{k=0}^{N}
    \left\lvert \hat{\varphi}[n, k] \right\rvert$$

where

- $\mathrm{princarg}(\theta) = \pi + ((\theta + \pi) mod (-2\pi))$
- $\varphi(t, f) = \mathrm{arg}(X(t, f))$
- $\hat{\varphi}(t, f) = \mathrm{princarg} \left( \frac{\partial^2 \varphi}{\partial t^2}(t, f)  \right)$

The phase deviation function can result in false positives as
phase changes occur in noisy signals.

### Complex Distance

Another ODF is presented in [@duxbury] that qualifies changes in both
magnitude and phase in order to detect percussing *and* tonal onsets.

$$D_{\mathbb{C}}[n] = \sum\limits_{k=0}^{N}
    \norm{\hat{X}[n, k] - X[n, k]}^2$$

where
$\hat{X}[n, k] = \abs{X[n, k]} \cdot e^{j\hat{\varphi}[n, k]}$

The presented function combines spectral difference and phase-based approaches,
by borrowing the phase deviation function from [@bello]

## Thresholding & Peak-picking

Since Onset Detection Functions are usually sensitive
to the slightest perturbations, false positives belong
to a subset of the local maxima of the ODF.
In order to filter such values, a smoothed version of the ODF
can serve as threshold for eliminating insignificant peaks.

A windowed moving average is a good threshold function,
it is defined as the convolution product of the ODF
with the window function.
In our implementation we have used a Hann window as it
limits the aliasing phenomenon in spectras.

## Results

We apply our onset detection pipeline to the same
audio sample of Beethoven's "Für Elise".

```{python onset_complex}
from muallef.onset import Onset

fur_elise.cut(stop=5)
fs = fur_elise.sampleRate
x = fur_elise.signal
t = fur_elise.time()

onset = Onset(x, fs, method='complex')
onsets = onset()

fig, ax = plt.subplots(2, 1, sharex=True)
fig.set_figheight(6)
_ = fig.suptitle("Onset detection of Beethoven's \"Für Elise\"", fontsize=16)
_ = ax[0].set_title("Segmented time signal")
_ = ax[0].plot(t, x)
for on in onsets:
    _ = ax[0].axvline(x=on, color='red')
_ = ax[1].set_title("Complex difference ODF")
_ = ax[1].plot(onset.onsetTime, onset.onsetFunction)
_ = ax[1].set_xlabel('Time (s)')
plt.show()
```
